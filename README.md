# tip-link-regeneration-model
Code for tip-link regeneration simulation
**************************
Created in Mathematica 11.1.1.0
**************************
Requires Mathematica for execution (compatible with Mathematica versions 9-11)
**************************
User specifies a set of values for the parameters used in the simulation, as well as a location for the output files. The program runs the simulation multiple times, with each run spanning a given number of iterations (comparable to time in an experiment). The four separate runs generate: (1) an animation of a single run; (2) a plot of simulated transduction current in response to a stimulus using the normal (physiological) axis, where a user-defined number of runs that are averaged together; (3) a similar plot of transduction current in response to a stimulus using the orthogonal axis; and (4) plot (and spreadsheet output) of single-run and averaged link data for straight and angled links in the PC and CP polarities, as well as the number of straight or angled links associated with a superior link
